       <p> Brendan Fraser was the beloved icon of our childhood, but where did his career go? Brendan Fraser is an American actor best known for his roles in films such as Encino Man, the Mummy trilogy, George of the Jungle, and Looney Tunes: Back in Action. Brendan Fraser was born December 3, 1968 in Indianapolis before moving around his childhood until he moved to Hollywood and got his first break in 1991. During his career, Fraser amassed a net worth estimated to be over $25 million dollars. Sadly for Mr. Fraser, his earnings were stripped from him following his 2007 divorce and subsequent alimony payments for his 3 children that at one point were totaling over $900,000 annually.  Currently, Fraser lives on a farm in upstate New York where he spends his free time with his children and horses. In 2018, Brendan Fraser plays a leading role in a TV show called Trust that tells the story of the kidnapping of oil heir John Paul Getty III. </p>
